	<p class="intro">
	Once the old civilization has consumed itself from sickening greed and ignorance,</br> 
	those remaining will have learned this lesson the hard way.</br> 
	That the sun does not revolve around the Earth and God did not make us in their image alone.</br> 
	That the Earth was not made for our benefit, but for us to protect it. and we will learn that we had failed.

	<h2>Outlands</h2>
	<p>
	Retreat to the outlands</br>
	where the grid's reach halts, and the grass grows green.</br>
	Out where there lives no man,</br>
	and we won't be held to the hell of man's greed.</br>
	Now escape no one can.</br>
	Of man's legacy? there will be no memories.

	<h2>Krakatoa</h2>
	<p>
	molten, fiery vermillion</br>
	ignites the midnight sky.</br>
	encroaching plumes of relentless soot clouds</br>
	surround and suffocate even the Gods</br>
	who recoil from the violent</br>
	and visceral stings of</br>
	cracking lightning lashes:</br>
	brilliant flashes formed from cries of vengeful creatures.</br>
	And our Gods flee,</br>
	</br>
	to leave us</br> 
	</br>
	to the mercy of Krakatoa.</br>
	fragmented shards rip across and cut the sky</br>
	allowing blood, ash, and terror to rain down.</br>
	run now.</br>

	<h2>Falling Cradle</h2>
	<p>
	When the wind blows</br>
	the cradle falls.</br>
	Will it be enough</br>
	once you've had it all?</br>
	Fill your husk</br>
	with misery.</br>
	Plead and cry</br>
	but you haven't changed.</br>
	Expect no grace once it comes undone.
